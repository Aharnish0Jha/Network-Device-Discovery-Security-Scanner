# 🔍 Network Device Discovery & Security Scanner

A real-time network scanning and security tool that helps you **see everything connected to your WiFi/network**, scan for vulnerabilities, and generate detailed reports with data visualizations.

🚧 **Note:** This project is still under development. Many improvements and optimizations are planned (see [Future Improvements](#-future-improvements) section).

## ✨ Features Implemented So Far

* 🌐 **Device Discovery** – Automatically scans your network and lists all connected devices with IP, MAC, vendor, and open ports.
* 🛡️ **Vulnerability Scanning** – Performs basic scans to identify insecure services, weak configurations, and potential risks.
* 📊 **Interactive Dashboard** – Streamlit-based dashboard with live data visualization, device statistics, and threat-level indicators.
* 📑 **Reporting System** – Export results in multiple formats (CSV, TXT, PDF) with professional auto-generated PDF reports for admins.
* ⚡ **Actionable Insights** – Provides visibility into the network and highlights risky devices so administrators can **secure their network before attackers exploit it**.

## 🎯 Why This Project Helps

Most people don’t realize how many devices are connected to their network—or whether they’re secure.
This tool helps by:

* ✅ Giving **complete visibility** of all devices on your WiFi/network.
* ✅ Detecting **insecure or outdated devices** that could be exploited.
* ✅ Allowing admins to **take action early** to improve overall security.
* ✅ Presenting data in a **visual and easy-to-understand** format instead of raw scan logs.

## 🚧 Future Improvements

Planned fixes and upgrades:

* 🔔 **Real-time Alerting** – Notify when a new/unknown device connects.
* 🤖 **AI/ML-based Risk Prediction** – Predict potential threats using anomaly detection models.
* 🕵️ **Deeper Vulnerability Analysis** – Integration with CVE databases for known exploits.
* 🌍 **Web-based Access** – Make the dashboard accessible over the web (with authentication).
* 🔒 **Role-Based Access Control** – Secure access for different levels of admins.
* 🚀 **Performance Optimization** – Faster scans and lightweight resource usage.
